## Programming Questions
# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Use "matrix()" to create a matrix of 2 rows by 5 columns filled by row
    with the numbers 1 through 10. Assign this matrix to an object called "x".
  CorrectAnswer: x <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'x <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)',
      'x <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)',
      'x <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)',
      'x <- matrix(seq(10), nrow = 2, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)',
      'x <- matrix(seq(10), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)',
      'x <- matrix(seq(10), ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)'
    )
  Hint: See 'Matrix in R'

# Question 7

  CorrectAnswer: rowMeans(x)
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'rowMeans(x)',
      'rowSums(x) / ncol(x)',
      'apply(x, 1, mean)',
      'c(mean(x[1, ]), mean(x[2, ]))'
    )
  Hint: See 'Matrix in R'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
