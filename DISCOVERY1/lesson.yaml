  Output: >
    Chapter 5 introduces many concepts related to discovery,
    one of which is 'unsupervised learning'.

# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What is an example of an ''unsupervised learning'' problem?'
  AnswerChoices: >
    Finding topics in a set of newspaper articles;
    Discovering ideological differences among legislators;
    Identifying commonly used words in an author's corpus; All of these
  CorrectAnswer: All of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "All of these")
  Hint: See Chapter 5.

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    How did unsupervised learning enable researchers to address the disputed
    authorship of the Federalist Papers?
  AnswerChoices: >
    Hamilton and Madison preferred to discuss different topics;
    Hamilton and Madison favored different words;
    Madison left coded messages in his prose; All of these
  CorrectAnswer: Hamilton and Madison favored different words
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctVal = 'Hamilton and Madison favored different words')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    What kind of information does a document-term matrix like "dtm" contain?
  AnswerChoices: >
    Term frequencies across a set of documents;
    The number of times a word is used in a document;
    The number of documents that contain a word at least once; All of these
  CorrectAnswer: All of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = "All of these")
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    Why does working with a document-term matrix require us to make the
    'bag-of-words' assumption?'
  AnswerChoices: >
    A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words;
    A document-term matrix contains a lot of words;
    A document-term matrix sorts similar words into bags; None of these
  CorrectAnswer: >
    A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctVal =
        'A document-term matrix says nothing about grammar or order of words'
    )
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

## Programming Questions
# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Chapter 5 also introduces several important R extensions, or packages.
    Use the "install.packages()" function to install the "wordcloud" package.
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages("wordcloud")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'install.packages("wordcloud")')

# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Now call the "library()" function to load the "wordcloud" package.'
  CorrectAnswer: library(wordcloud)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library(wordcloud)', 'library("wordcloud")')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

- Class: text
  Output: >
    We will use the "wordcloud" package to visualize a document-term matrix
    called "dtm", which has already been loaded for you.

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Use the "inspect()" function to visualize the first 5 rows and 8 columns of
    "dtm".
  CorrectAnswer: inspect(dtm[1:5, 1:8])
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'inspect(dtm[1:5, 1:8])',
      'inspect(dtm[seq(5), seq(8)])',
      'inspect(dtm[1:5, seq(8)])',
      'inspect(dtm[seq(5), 1:8])'
    )
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Currently, "dtm" belongs to a special R class called "DocumentTermMatrix".
    This object class is not easily manipulated in R.
    Using the as.matrix() function, coerce "dtm" to a matrix object in R
    called "dtm.mat".
  CorrectAnswer: dtm.mat <- as.matrix(dtm)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dtm.mat <- as.matrix(dtm)")
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Finally, use the wordcloud() function to visualize the information contained
    in the eighth document of "dtm.mat" only.
  CorrectAnswer: wordcloud(colnames(dtm.mat), dtm.mat[8, ])
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctExpr = 'wordcloud(colnames(dtm.mat), dtm.mat[8, ])')
  Hint: See 'The Disputed Authorship of The Federalist Papers'.

# Question 10
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    Which of these do you think best describes the topic of the eighth
    Federalist Paper?
  AnswerChoices: >
    The costs and benefits of standing militia;
    Trade between the colonies;
    The universal rights of man;
    The abolition of slavery
  CorrectAnswer: The costs and benefits of standing militia
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctVal = "The costs and benefits of standing militia")
