# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    I roll a fair 6-sided die 3,000,000 times.
    The number 1 turns up approximately 500,000 times,
    so I conclude that the probability of a 1 is 1/6.
    This is the ___ approach to probability.
  AnswerChoices: '"Frequentist"; "Bayesian"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'Frequentist'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"Frequentist"')
  Hint: See 6.1.1.

# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question

    Suppose that P(A)=0.4 and P(B)=0.3.

  CorrectAnswer: '0.1'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.1', correctVal = 0.1)
  Hint: >
    See the Law of Total Probability.
    What happens if B is entirely contained in A?

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question

    (including the original word),
    what is the probability that the letter I comes first?
  AnswerChoices: '0.1; 0.2; 0.3; 0.4'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    Which of these is NOT the numerator of a correct use of Bayes Rule
    and/or the definition of conditional probability, for P(A | B, C)?
  AnswerChoices: >
    P(B | A, C) P(A | C); P(B, C | A) P(A); P(A, B, C); P(A, B | C) P(C)
  CorrectAnswer: 'P(A, B | C) P(C)'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='P(A, B | C) P(C)')
  Hint: See 6.2.3.

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    A disease affects 1% of the population.
    The only test for the disease returns positive 99% of the time
    the disease is actually there, though it returns positive 20% of the time
    if the disease is not actually there.
    You take this test and it returns positive.
    What is the probability you have the disease (rounded to nearest 0.01)?
  CorrectAnswer: '0.05'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.05', correctVal = 0.05)
  Hint: See Section 6.2 on Conditional Probability.

# Question 6
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    What was the conditional independence assumption we made in our
    race + surname example?
  AnswerChoices: >
    Once we know the race of the individual,
    we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.;
    Once we know the probabilities of the predictor variables
    we can assume that the race of the individual is independent.;
    Once we know the probability of the race
    we can assume the probabilities of the predictor variables are independent.
  CorrectAnswer: >
    Once we know the race of the individual,
    we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctVal =
        'Once we know the race of the individual, we can assume that the predictor variables are independent.'
    )
  Hint: See 6.3.2.

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Let A and B be two independent variables that take on only
    the values 0 and 1. If P(A=1, B=1)=0.12, P(A=0, B=1)=0.28,
    and P(A=1)=0.3, what is P(A=0, B=0)?
  CorrectAnswer: '0.42'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.42', correctVal = 0.42)
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 8
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    There are three prisoners: A, B, & C. One prisoner, selected uniformly at
    random, will be pardoned while the other two will be executed. Prisoner A
    asks the jailer (who knows) to tell him one of the prisoners who will be
    executed: "If I will be pardoned, just flip a coin and tell me B or C; if C
    will be pardoned, tell me B; and if B will be pardoned, tell me C." The
    jailer says B will be executed. Using Bayes Rule, what is the numerator of
    the expression evaluating the probability that C is pardoned?
  AnswerChoices: >
    P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned);
    P(B is executed | C is pardoned) * P(B is executed);
    P(C is pardoned | jailer says B is executed) * P(B is executed)
  CorrectAnswer: >
    P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctVal =
        'P(jailer says B executed | C is pardoned) * P(C is pardoned)'
    )
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Based on the previous question,
    what is the probability of C being pardoned (express to the nearest 0.01)?
  CorrectAnswer: '0.67'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.67', correctVal = 0.67)
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    You have a bucket with 2 coins:
    one is a regular coin, while the other has heads on both sides.
    You pick a coin at random and flip it: it turns up heads.
    What is the probability you chose the fair coin
    (express to the nearest 0.01)?
  CorrectAnswer: '0.33'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '0.33', correctVal = 0.33)
  Hint: See 6.2.2.

# Question 11
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Suppose again, you have that bucket with 2 coins, one a regular coin and the
    other w/heads on both sides. You pick a coin at random. If at any point you
    get a tail, you obviously picked the fair coin. If you keep getting heads,
    you stop & decide it is the unfair coin, but only if the probability you
    picked the fair coin is less than 1/1000, and otherwise you keep flipping.
    What is the minimum number of times you must flip heads in a row before you
    can decide it is indeed the unfair coin?'
  CorrectAnswer: '10'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '10', correctVal = 10)
  Hint: See 6.2.2.
