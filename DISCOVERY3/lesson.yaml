## Programming Questions
- Class: text
  Output: 'The "maps" package has been pre-loaded to assist with this lesson.'

# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Use the "map()" function to draw a map of the United States.'
  CorrectAnswer: map(database = "usa")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'map(database = "usa")')
  Hint: See 'Spatial Data in R'

# Question 7
- Class: text
  Output: 'From the "maps" package we have also loaded the dataset "us.cities".'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Using the "subset()" function, create an "data.frame" object
    called "lrgcities" which only contains cities with populations
    greater than 100,000. The variable for population in the "us.cities" dataset
    is called "pop".
  CorrectAnswer: lrgcities <- subset(us.cities, pop > 100000, )
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctExpr = 'lrgcities <- subset(us.cities, pop > 100000,)')
  Hint: See 'Spatial Data in R'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Next, we want to save the USA database as a list and not a plot.
    Save it to an object called "usa".
  CorrectAnswer: usa <- map(database = "usa", plot = FALSE)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctExpr = 'usa <- map(database = "usa", plot = FALSE)')
  Hint: See 'Spatial Data in R'

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Call the "map()" function with the database set to "state",
    regions to "New Jersey" and plot to "FALSE",
    and save the output to an object called "nj".
  CorrectAnswer: >-
    nj <- map(database = "state", regions = "New Jersey", plot = FALSE)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(
      correctExpr =
        'nj <- map(database = "state", regions = "New Jersey", plot = FALSE)'
    )
  Hint: See 'Spatial Data in R'

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Use the "rgb()" function to assign the hexadecimal code for the color blue
    to the object "blue".
  CorrectAnswer: blue <- rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1)
  AnswerTests: >-
    omnitest(correctExpr = 'blue <- rgb(red = 0, green = 0, blue = 1)')
