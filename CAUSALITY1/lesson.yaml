## Conceptual Questions
# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    Suppose a variable is binary, that is, it takes on values of either 0 or 1
    (for example, female gender).
    Which of the following is the same as its sample mean?
  AnswerChoices: 'the sample median; the sample rate of 1''s; neither of these'
  CorrectAnswer: the sample rate of 1's
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="the sample rate of 1's")
  Hint: 'Think about the formula for the mean.'

# Question 2
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'What kind of value is "FALSE"?'
  AnswerChoices: '"character"; "logical"; "binary"; "numeric"'
  CorrectAnswer: 'logical'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='"logical"')
  Hint: 'See ''Subsetting the Data in R''.'

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Translate the following statement using R's logical values
    (i.e., "TRUE" and "FALSE") and operators (i.e., !, =, &, and |):
    True or false is not false.
  CorrectAnswer: (TRUE | FALSE) == !FALSE
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      "(TRUE | FALSE) == !FALSE", "TRUE | FALSE == !FALSE",
      "TRUE | FALSE != FALSE", "(TRUE | FALSE) != FALSE",
      "T|F != F", "(T|F) != F", "T|F == !F", "(T|F) == !F"
    )
  Hint: >
    See 'Subsetting the Data in R'
    (and be sure you use proper capitalization and spacing!).

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    In order to calculate the mean of a variable we have used the "length()"
    function in the denominator.
    The "length()" of a vector is equivalent to __________
  AnswerChoices: 'the number of elements; the height; the maximum'
  CorrectAnswer: the number of elements
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='the number of elements')
  Hint: See 'Subsetting'

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'How are factor variables different from categorical variables?'
  AnswerChoices: >
    They are the same; Factor variables contain numeric values;
    Categorical variables tend to have more levels or categories
  CorrectAnswer: They are the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='They are the same')
  Hint: 'See ''Subsetting the Data in R''.'

## Programming questions
- Class: text
  Output: >
    A variety of external data files can be loaded into R,
    such as tables with comma separated values (or CSV's)
    and R Workspace files (RData files).

# Question 1
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    Using the read.csv() function, we have pre-loaded the external data file
    "resume.csv" as an object called "resume". Call the head() function to look
    at the first six rows of "resume".
  CorrectAnswer: head(resume)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("head(resume)", "head(resume, 6)")
  Hint: 'See ''Data Files'' in Chapter 1.'

# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Find the dimensions of "resume".'
  CorrectAnswer: dim(resume)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="dim(resume)")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 3
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    This question has two parts. First, create a summary of "resume" that
    contains, along with other information, the sample means of each variable
    in "resume".
  CorrectAnswer: summary(resume)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="summary(resume)")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    Second, looking at the summary of "resume", what was the callback rate
    in the data? In other words, about what percent of the fictitious applicants
    received a call back?
  AnswerChoices: '2%; 16%; 8%; 9%'
  CorrectAnswer: 8%
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="8%")
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'

# Question 5
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    "resume" contains two binary variables, "sex" and "call".
    Create a table that compares the number of female applicants to the number
    of male applicants who did and did not receive a call back.
    Be sure to label the rows as 'sex' and the columns as 'call'.
  CorrectAnswer: table(sex = resume$sex, call = resume$call)
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      "table(sex = resume$sex, call = resume$call)",
      "with(resume, table(sex = sex, call = call))"
    )
  Hint: 'See ''Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market''.'
