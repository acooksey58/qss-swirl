# Question 1
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    True or False: A positive correlation means that one variable is more likely
    to be above its mean when the other variable is also above its mean.
  AnswerChoices: 'True; False'
  CorrectAnswer: 'True'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='True')
  Hint: See 'Correlationa and Scatterplot'

# Question 2
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    The intercept a in the model y = a + bx + e represents
    the average value of y when x is equal to _____.
  CorrectAnswer: '0'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='0')
  Hint: See 'Least squares'

# Question 3
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    We use the regression line to predict the value of the outcome variable
    y hat, otherwise known as _____.
  AnswerChoices: 'predicted value; fitted value; both of these'
  CorrectAnswer: both of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='both of these')
  Hint: See 'Least squares'

# Question 4
- Class: mult_question
  Output: 'An R^2 close to 1 suggests the model fits ___________'
  AnswerChoices: 'well; not well'
  CorrectAnswer: well
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='well')
  Hint: See 'Model Fit'

# Question 5
- Class: mult_question
  Output: >
    The difference between the observed outcome and its predicted value is
    called a _______.
  AnswerChoices: 'residual; prediction error; either of these'
  CorrectAnswer: either of these
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='either of these')
  Hint: See 'Least Squares'

## Programming Questions
# Question 6
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'In the model y = 5 + 2x, what is the intercept?'
  CorrectAnswer: '5'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='5')
  Hint: See 'Least Squares'

# Question 7
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: >
    We have included two vectors x and y.
    Regress y on x and assign it to an object called "fit".
  CorrectAnswer: fit <- lm(y ~ x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit <- lm(y ~ x)')
  Hint: See 'Least Squares'

# Question 8
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Type in the "fit" object to see what it looks like.'
  CorrectAnswer: fit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='fit')
  Hint: See 'Least Squares'

# Question 9
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'How do you see the estimated coefficients from the "fit" object?'
  CorrectAnswer: coef(fit)
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'coef(fit)',
      'coefficients(fit)',
      'fit$coef',
      'fit$coefficients'
    )
  Hint: See 'Least Squares'

# Question 10
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'What are the predicted values?'
  CorrectAnswer: fitted(fit)
  AnswerTests: >-
    any_of_exprs(
      'fitted(fit)',
      'fit$fitted.values',
